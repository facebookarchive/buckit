# These header suffixes are used to logically group C/C++ source (e.g.
# `foo/Bar.cpp`) with headers with the following suffixes (e.g. `foo/Bar.h` and
# `foo/Bar-inl.tcc`), such that the source provides all implementation for
# methods/classes declared in the headers.
#
# This is important for a couple reasons:
# 1) Automatic dependencies: Tooling can use this property to automatically
#    manage TARGETS dependencies by extracting `#include` references in sources
#    and looking up the rules which "provide" them.
# 2) Modules: This logical group can be combined into a standalone C/C++ module
#    (when such support is available).
