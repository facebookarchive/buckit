    Helps run integration tests to test .bzl files

    This rule is mostly a wrapper around python_test that adds the correct
    dependencies and resources needed to utilize an integration testing
    framework found in fbcode_macros//tests/utils.py. See
    fbcode_macros//tests:config_test for an example.

    These integration tests take two forms, simple evaluation of statements,
    and evaluation and comparison of full build files. This is acheived by
    running buck directly to evaluate outputs. This also runs both the python
    interpreter, and the skylark interpreter for the same rules and verifies
    that they both pass the tests

    Note that resources that are added will be put in a directory according to
    their cell and path. That is, fbcode_macros//build_defs:config.bzl is
    available at fbcode_macros/build_defs/config.bzl in the test. If a
    cell is created in the test, it will look in this directory to populate
    which macros should be available to tests.

    Example:
        skylark_integration_test(
            name = "read_config_test",
            resources = XPLAT_RESOURCES + ["xplat//config:read_config.bzl"],
            srcs = ["read_config_test.py"],
        )

    Args:
        name: The name of the rule
        deps: A normal list of deps for python_test
        resources: If a list is provided, convert the destination paths as
                   above. If a dictionary is provided, paths will not be changed
