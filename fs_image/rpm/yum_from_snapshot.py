This tool wraps `yum`, with two changes to ensure more hermetic behavior:

  - The `yum.conf`, the repo metadata, and the RPM contents are all served
    out of a directory produced `snapshot-repos`, **not** against some kind
    of live, external RPM repo collection.  So if both the snapshot, and
    `fs_images/rpm` are committed to the same version control, then a single
    version ID completely determines the outcome of a yum command.

  - The `yum` invocation runs in a Linux namespaces sandbox with an isolated
    network, and with some additional bind mounts that are intended to
    prevent `yum` from accessing host configuration, state, or caches.

Put in other words, we first configure yum to act in a deterministic
fashion, and later execute it in a sandbox to prevent its non-isolatable
features from behaving non-determinitically.

Sample usage:

    buck run TARGET_PATH:yum-from-snapshot -- \\
        --storage '{"key": "SOME_KEY", "kind": "SOME_KIND", ...}' \\
        --snapshot-dir REPOS_PATH --install-root TARGET_DIR -- \\
            install --assumeyes some-package-name

Note that we have TWO `--` arguments, with the first protecting the
wrapper's arguments from `buck`, and the second protecting `yum`'s arguments
from the wrapper.

It should be safe to `--assumeyes` (which auto-imports GPG keys), because:
  - The snapshot repo server runs on localhost and only listens inside an
    ephemeral private network namespace, making compromise unlikely.
  - The repo server verifies RPM & repodata checksums against the
    version-controlled snapshot before sending them out.
  - Snapshotted repos are required to have `gpgcheck` enabled. When
    `snapshot-repos` downloads GPG keys, it checks them against a
    predetermined whitelist, protecting us against transient key injections.
    Many other sanity checks happen at snapshot time.

Note that this still uses the host system's `yum`, so version upgrades can
definitely break reproducibility & hermeticity.  See the notes in "Future
Work" about a "yum appliance", which would address this concern.

## Future work

The current tool works well, with these caveats:

  - Yum leaves various caches inside `--install-root`, which bloat the image.
    The image-building infra must support some kind of cleanup layer.

  - Base CentOS packages deposit a vanilla CentOS `yum` configuration into
    the install root via `/etc/yum.repos.d/`, bearing no relation to the
    `yum.conf` that was used to install packages into the image.

  - Using the host `yum` may cause hermeticity issues due to OS upgrades.
    This would be fixed by the "yum appliance" work below.

  - This is significantly slower than vanilla `yum`. On a flash-disk host,
    a vanilla `yum install net-tools` takes about 1:00, while the current
    `yum-from-snapshot` needs 3:40. The two major reasons are:

      * `repo-server` could be faster, specifically it (i) should support
        serving multiple files in parallel, (ii) the Facebook-production
        blob store has some notes on how to eliminate the ~1 second-per-blob
        fetch latency at the expense of 1-2 days of work, (iii) some caching
        of blobs may help, (iv) we could add a SQLite version of the
        JSON snapshot data into the blobstore for faster boot.

      * Since we typically run `yum` in an empty clean install-root, the
        initial run is extra-slow due to having to download the repodata,
        and build the local DB / populate local caches.  The "yum appliance"
        work below will speed this up dramatically.

  - This brings up and tears down network namespaces frequently. According
    to ast@kernel.org, bugs are routinely introduced that break NETNS
    clean-up, which may cause us to leak namespaces in production. If this
    becomes an issue, we can try cgroup-bpf style firewalling instead,
    along the lines of the program in `bind4_prog_load` in the kernel's
    `test_sock_addr.c`.

  - When installing into a blank root, `yum` cannot discover the release, so
    it literally has `/repos/x86_64/$releasever` as the 'persistdir'
    subdirectory.  How should we determine the correct release for a
    snapshot-based install?  Fake it?  Add `/etc/*-release` from the
    snapshot host to the snapshot?

Besides the easy fix of parallelizing `repo-server`, the best
reward-for-effort improvement to `yum-from-snapshot` would come from
building a "yum appliance", along these lines:

  - For each new repo snapshot, we eagerly construct an OS image (either via
    continuous integration + build cache, or by doing it at snapshot time
    and committing it as a blob to `--storage` with a pointer from the repo
    snapshot directory, or both).

  - The image should contain:
      * `yum-from-snapshot install yum` -- i.e. we use the current script
        to bootstrap the image.
      * A pre-configured `yum.conf` deriving from the repo snapshot that
        originated the `yum` RPM in the image.
      * Warm YUM caches / persistent directories. I believe the bootstrap
        `yum` will already populate these, but this remains to be tested.
        One would also tweak `yum.conf` or `cachecookie`s to ensure the
        cache never expires.
      * [optionally] The repo snapshot data to allow running `repo-server`
        against the appliance image.
      * [optionally] `yum-from-snapshot` with its baked-in `repo-server`.
        One could `nspawn --bind /install_root --private-network -x` into
        the image to use `yum-from-snapshot` in a truly hermetic way.
