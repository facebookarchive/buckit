'''
Produces a repo-atomic snapshot of every repo in the specified `yum.conf`
(details on the atomicity guarantee in the `repo_downloader.py` docblock).

Note that there is no way to capture all repos atomically, so if e.g.  an
RPM is moved from one repo to another, it is possible for the RPM to either
occur in BOTH repos, or in NEITHER, depending on how the move is executed.
We hope that RPM moves are implemented so that the repo gaining the RPM is
re-indexed before the repo losing the RPM, because the snapshotter has no
recourse if the ground truth repo data transiently loses some RPMs.
Furthermore, multi-repo updates ought to try to swap out all the
`repomd.xml`s in as short a time as possible to minimize th chance of races.

Future: We should download the `repomd.xml` files repeatedly in the same
sequence with a short delay, until they no longer change.  Then we know that
we did not race a multi-repo update (or that the update was very slow, for
which we can never have a proper recourse) and can proceed to snapshot all
these `repomd.xml`s.  Note: if we take too long with the snapshots, it is
possible for some of the repodata or RPMs backing these `repomd.xml`s to get
deleted.  This can be mitigated e.g. by doing uncontrolled snapshots (what
we have today) across many shards, and once most of the snapshots are
up-to-date to do the 0:1 snapshot with the above `repomd.xml` checks.
