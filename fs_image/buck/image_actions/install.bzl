`image.install_executable("//path/fs:exe", "dir/foo")` copies executable
artifact `exe` to `dir/foo` in the image (see below for "executable" details),
`image.install_data("//path/fs:data", "dir/bar")` copies non-executable
artifact `data` to `dir/bar` in the image --

Files to copy can be specified using `image.source` (use this to grab one file
from a directory or layer output, docs in `image_source.bzl`), or as string
target paths.

`stat (2)` attributes can be changed via these keys (defaults shown below):
  - 'mode': 'a+r' for `install_data`, 'a+rx' for `install_executable`
  - 'user': 'root'
  - 'group': 'root'

Prefer to omit the keys instead of repeating the defaults in your spec.

`dest` must be an image-absolute path, including a filename for the file being
copied. The parent directory of `dest` must get created by another image
feature.

If the file being copied is a buck-runnable (e.g. `cpp_binary`,
`python_binary`), use `install_executable`.  Ditto for copying executable files
from inside directories output by other (custom?) executable rules. For
everything else, use `install_data` [1].

The implementation of `install_executable` differs significantly in `@mode/dev`
in order to support the execution of in-place binaries (dynamically linked C++,
linktree Python) from within an image.  Internal implementation differences
aside, the resulting image should "quack" like your real, production
`@mode/opt`.

[1] Corner case: if you want to copy a non-executable file from inside a
directory output by a Buck target, which is marked executable, then you should
use `install_data`, even though the underlying rule is executable.

Design note: This API forces you to distinguish between source targets that are
executable and those that are not, because (until Buck supports providers), it
is not possible to deduce this automatically at parse-time.
