See the docblock of `provides.py` for an explanation of the
Requires-Provides data model, and their interactions.

Future: we might want to add permissions constraints, tackle following
symlinks (or not following them), maybe hardlinks, etc.  This would
likely best be tackled via predicate composition with And/Or/Not support
with short-circuiting.  E.g. FollowsSymlinks(Pred) would expand to:

  Or(
    And(IsSymlink(Path), Pred(SymlinkTarget(Path))),
    And(Not(IsSymlink(Path)), Pred(SymlinkTarget(Path)),
  )

The predicates would then be wrapped into a PathObject.
