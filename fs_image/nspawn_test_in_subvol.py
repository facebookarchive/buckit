This is almost identical to `nspawn-run-in-subvol`, so read its `--help`, or
the docblock at the top of `nspawn_in_subvol.py`, for an introduction.

However, this expects to run a specific command, `/layer-test-binary`,
inside the image, and takes the liberty of rewriting one of its arguments,
as documented in `rewrite_test_cmd`.

    The FB test main has an `--output PATH` option, which requires us to
    exfiltrate data from inside the container to the host.

    There are a couple of complications with this:
      - The user running `buck test` will commonly be different from the
        user excuting the test inside the container, yet they need to access
        the same file.  It would not be ideal to mark the output path
        world-writable to make this work.  Nor would it be great to be doing
        a bunch of `chmod`s as `root` -- consider that it's actually not
        trivial to figure out what the UID of the requested container user
        will be.
      - Since the test runner controls the path, it's not ideal to have to
        create a matching directory hiearchy it in the container.

    To deal with these, To achieve this, the current function:
      - (partially) parses `cmd`,
      - opens PATH for writing,
      - forwards the resulting FD into the container, and injects an
        accessor for the received FD into the test's command-line.
